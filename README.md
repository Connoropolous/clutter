Clutter rewritten in Redux/React

This app was bootstrapped using create-react-app. But you can just git clone it and then do `$ npm install` to install dependencies, and then `$ npm start` to boot up the server. 
You should also be running `$ hcdev web` on the clutter app of holochain. 
It is set up to proxy from port 3000 which this runs on to port 4141 which is default for holochain
